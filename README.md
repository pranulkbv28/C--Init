# Starting C# from Scratch: A Beginner's Guide

## Introduction

- **C#** is a programming language used to build a wide range of applications.
- It is an **object-oriented programming language**, which means it focuses on objects and classes to create reusable code.
- C# is a **strongly typed language**, enforcing type safety, which helps catch errors during compile time.
- It is a **multi-paradigm language**, supporting various programming styles such as imperative, declarative, functional, and event-driven programming.
- C# is **platform-independent**; applications can run on different platforms using the .NET framework.

## How to Start a C# Project

1. Download [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
2. Follow the installation instructions to set up Visual Studio on your system.
3. Once installed, launch Visual Studio and create a new project.
4. Select **C#** as your programming language and choose a project template (e.g., Console App, Windows Forms App, etc.).
5. Start coding and building your application!

## How to push the code to GitHub

1. Keep in mind that you need to **initalize** an empty repository in the same path as the `.sln` file in your project.
2. This is usually found in the **1st level below** the main directory
3. After initializing your empty repository, **close** the `Visual Studio 2022` app and the perform these steps in your terminal:

```bash
git add.
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin <your-branch>
```

## How to Open an already existing C# Project
